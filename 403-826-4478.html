From January to March, European smartphone shipments decreased by 6.3% compared with the same period last year. Of these, shipments in Western Europe fell by 13.9%, but the number of smartphones in central and Eastern Europe increased by 12.3%, which came from the excellent performance of the Russian market.
According to data from the market research group, the number of smartphone sales worldwide dropped by 2% in the first quarter. Smartphone vendors are lamenting the decline in smartphone sales, even in India and China, where the market is growing.
Samsung shipped 15 million smartphones in Europe, down 15% from the first quarter of 2017. Apple Corp's iPhone sales were 10 million, down 5.4% from a year earlier.
While Apple Corp is trying to cope with a slowdown in global smartphone sales through high-end mobile phone sales, iPhone SE, 6 and 6S still occupy 25% of European shipments.
